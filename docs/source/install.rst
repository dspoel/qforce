Installation
====================

You can install `Q-Force` from `GitHub
<https://github.com/selimsami/qforce>`_::

    pip install git+https://github.com/selimsami/qforce.git

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or newer (python --version)

If you can't call the qforce executable afterwards, make sure you have the python bin in your PATH.

If you work in a shared environment (cluster), install it locally with pip install --user
